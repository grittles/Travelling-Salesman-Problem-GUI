# Travelling Salesman Problem GUI

This program was made in C++ using Qt and Visual Studio 2022.
The goal of this program is to implement and visually compare different solutions to the TSP on a grid based system by combining the A* algorithm with various known solutions, as well as testing the efficacy of a reinforcement learning model in terms of speed and time complexity compared to algorithmic and heuristic approaches.
